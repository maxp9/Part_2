# App 1 - Bouncer - Temporary App Permissions  

[Link to download the app - Temporary App Permissions](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samruston.permission) 

Bouncer is an app permission control app for your smartphone. Nowadays, almost every app that you will install in your smartphone, asks for permissions like location, contacts, storage, camera, microphone, etc.. And after the install, the apps have permanent access to these permissions. This raises serious privacy concerns and also drains the phone’s battery. These apps can know your location, like where you are, where you were. They can harvest your data and even can sell it to the third party companies. Also, there is always a possibility that the apps can listen via your phone’s microphone, or can use the cameras without asking the user first, or can even harvest your contacts and storage data.

With the Bouncer app, you can temporarily allow permissions to the new or the already installed apps. You can set the permission time for 30 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours, and a day. You can also remove or keep the permission of all the installed or new apps.  

I chose this application as it is quite new and has a unique idea. The app’s interface is very simple and there is no bloating of adware or heavy graphics.

A user will want to use it as it not only provides increases privacy but also saves battery life by removing the permissions from apps which are just running in the background and keep tracking your location or using other phone’s services.
  
Bouncer app uses Android’s accessibility service. As soon as you grant any permission access to any app, the Bouncer app gets activated and gives you the option to either keep/remove or schedule the permission access.

This application’s strength is its simple and easy-to-use user-interface, its usage in increasing privacy, and in the process, saving the battery from being drained by the background apps.

The application has very limited features. One feature they can add is keeping a log of the apps harvesting our data or trying to get access to microphone or camera. The app is also not stable yet and crashed a few times (but then it is in beta phase).
 


# App 2 - Happy Glass

What does it do - It is a game in which we have to fill the empty glass with water. There is a water pipe through which water comes out with consistent pressure. But there can be obstacles between the water pipe and the glass or the glass can be away from the water drop point. We have an option to draw a line to direct the water flow into the glass. The length of the line drawn is inversely proportional to the number of stars you get in a particular level. So, shorter the line, more the stars. You can get maximum 3 stars in a level and minimum 1-star.

Why it was chosen - It is a new game which brings out best of your creativity and thinking. Launched last month (August 2018), the game already has more 10 million downloads at the Google Play Store and with average 4.4 ratings by around 100,000 reviewers. 

Why would someone use it - It is an addictive, fun game. It is a puzzle based game with the use of physics (gravity), which makes the game environment more real-like. It is a great time-pass game and also gives a sense of smartness on achieving 3-stars in any level.

Combination of technologies are leveraged - It is developed using C# and is built on Unity, a cross-platform game development engine.

Application's strengths and weaknesses - The simple yet polished user-interface (UI) and being addictive are its strengths. The major weakness of this game is that it has no option to save the game status on cloud. It does not have an option to connect via Google's Game Centre. So, if you try to play on some another device, then you will have to start from the first-level.

Suggest improvement that you would make - Reduce the number of Ads. They show one video-ad and one image banner ad after every level. They even have an ad on the game playing page. This is very annoying and many players have complained about this in the comments. Also, the multi-touch does not work in the game. Enable Google Game Centre connectivity option so that user can save the game status
